						<p>The accommodation for TaCoS is the <a href="https://www.jugendherberge.de/jugendherbergen/duesseldorf-442/portraet/">DJH Hostel</a>. From here, you can reach the venue by bus in only 20 minutes and each bus stop is right in front of your door. In the unlikely case that you would like to skip some talks during the conference, you may take a stroll at the Rhine or just go to town and enjoy DÃ¼sseldorf, which is right on the other side of the river. Beds in the accommodation are reserved on a 'first come first serve' basis depending on the time of your bank transfer of the conference fee. There are 40 beds available.</p>
