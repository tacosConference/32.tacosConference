					<p class="block">The 32nd TaCoS took place from June 29th to July 2nd 2023 in Düsseldorf (Germany) with overall 57 participants from five countries. The programme included 12 student talks, three student workshops and five keynote talks given by local professors and lecturers. It was also complemented by a Career & Networking Meet-Up, where students, professors and sponsors had the chance to network and talk about future opportunities in a relaxed atmosphere. As organisers, we are very pleased with how this year's TaCoS turned out, and we want to thank our participants and all those who helped make it possible for their contribution, expertise and enthusiasm about our conference - we are looking forward to the 33rd TaCoS in the coming year at: <br></p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">What is the TaCoS?</h2>
						<p class="block"> The Tagung der Computerlinguistik-Studierenden (TaCoS) was first organized in 1992 and takes place once every year. It offers students of computational linguistics and adjacent fields a chance to exchange views during talks and workshops. The conference is hosted by teams of student volunteers at their university. Participants traditionally receive accommodation and breakfast in exchange for a small fee. At the center of the conference stand talks, workshops, and poster sessions; each given by students for students. Established academics from the host university are invited as keynote speakers as well. In addition, there is a social program for everyone to connect and network.
						<br>
						This year marks the 32. TaCoS and our team at Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf is proud to host the event this summer.
